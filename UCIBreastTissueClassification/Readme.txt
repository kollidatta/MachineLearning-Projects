						
Six classes of freshly excised tissue were studied using electrical impedance measurements:						
				# of cases		
	Car	Carcinoma		21		
	Fad	Fibro-adenoma		15		
	Mas	Mastopathy		18		
	Gla	Glandular		16		
	Con	Connective		14		
	Adi	Adipose		22		
				106		
Impedance measurements were made at the frequencies: 15.625, 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000 KHz						
These measurements plotted in the (real, -imaginary) plane constitute 						
the impedance spectrum from where the features below are computed.						
						
						
9 features:						
						
	I0	Impedivity (ohm) at zero frequency				
	PA500	phase angle at 500 KHz				
	HFS	high-frequency slope of phase angle				
	DA	impedance distance between spectral ends				
	AREA	area under spectrum				
	A/DA	area normalized by DA				
	MAX IP	maximum of the spectrum				
	DR	distance between I0 and real part of the maximum frequency point				
	P	length of the spectral curve
